    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
   <p>Hi I'M Yunus, and I want to become a full-stack developer. This means I want to learn how to build both the front-end and back-end of websites and applications. The front-end is what users see and interact with, such as buttons, text, and images on a webpage, while the back-end is responsible for storing data, managing user requests, and making everything function properly behind the scenes. To achieve this goal, I need to learn various programming languages and technologies. For the front-end, I will focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with popular frameworks like React or Angular. On the back-end, I need to learn about databases, servers, and programming languages such as Node.js, Python, or PHP. I also want to understand how to connect the front-end and back-end so they work together smoothly. Becoming a full-stack developer requires practice, patience, and problem-solving skills, but I am excited about the journey. My goal is to build complete and functional web applications that can help businesses and users in their daily lives. With continuous learning and experience, I hope to become a skilled developer capable of handling real-world projects from start to finish.</p>
